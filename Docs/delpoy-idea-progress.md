   - Investigating ESLint warnings in src/app/profile/[id]/page.tsx

### Next Steps

1. Review UI for other potential enhancements
2. Consider converting more custom SVG icons to Ant Design components
3. Add documentation for UI component standards
4. Conduct a thorough ESLint compliance check across the entire codebase

## Technical Debt Addressed

- Simplified UI by removing redundant platform icons on content cards




########## Round 2 advice ##########

### **Updated Suggestions Based on Your New Logs**

Since the same ESLint issues persist despite the fixes, let's go step by step to make sure nothing is being missed.

---

## **1. Verify That ESLint is Actually Being Disabled During Build**
It looks like ESLint is **still running** in your deployment logs, even though you've attempted to disable it.

### **A. Double-check `next.config.js`**
Ensure your `next.config.js` (or `next.config.mjs`) contains this:
```js
/** @type {import('next').NextConfig} */
const nextConfig = {
  eslint: {
    ignoreDuringBuilds: true, // Ensures ESLint won't block the build
  },
};

export default nextConfig;
```

If using **TypeScript** (`next.config.ts`):
```ts
import type { NextConfig } from "next";

const nextConfig: NextConfig = {
  eslint: {
    ignoreDuringBuilds: true,
  },
};

export default nextConfig;
```

### **B. Modify `.env.production`**
Add this if not already present:
```
NEXT_DISABLE_ESLINT=1
```

### **C. Update `package.json` Build Script**
Ensure your `package.json` contains:
```json
"scripts": {
  "dev": "next dev",
  "build": "NEXT_DISABLE_ESLINT=1 next build",
  "start": "next start",
  "lint": "next lint"
}
```
ðŸš€ **Re-run the deployment after these changes.** If ESLint is still running, move to the next step.

---

## **2. Fully Remove Legacy `.eslintrc.json` (if applicable)**
Since Next.js 15 uses the new ESLint flat config system, having both `eslint.config.mjs` and `.eslintrc.json` can cause conflicts.

- **If you still have `.eslintrc.json`, delete it**:
  ```sh
  rm .eslintrc.json
  ```
- Instead, ensure you are using `eslint.config.mjs`:
  ```js
  import { FlatCompat } from "@eslint/eslintrc";

  const compat = new FlatCompat();

  export default [
    ...compat.extends("next/core-web-vitals", "next/typescript"),
    {
      rules: {
        "@typescript-eslint/no-unused-vars": "warn",
        "react/no-unescaped-entities": "warn",
        "@next/next/no-img-element": "warn",
        "@typescript-eslint/no-explicit-any": "warn",
        "react-hooks/exhaustive-deps": "warn"
      },
      ignores: ["node_modules/**", ".next/**", "public/**"]
    }
  ];
  ```
---

## **3. Check If ESLint is Running Locally Before Deploying**
To confirm whether ESLint errors are causing the failure **before deploying to Vercel**, try this:

1. **Run ESLint Locally**
   ```sh
   npm run lint
   ```
   If this shows errors, they need to be fixed or suppressed before deployment.

2. **Try a Local Production Build**
   ```sh
   npm run build
   ```
   If the build fails locally, fix errors before deploying.

3. **If the Build Fails, Temporarily Skip Linting Locally**
   ```sh
   NEXT_DISABLE_ESLINT=1 npm run build
   ```
   If this works locally but Vercel still fails, then Vercel is likely ignoring the env setting.

---

## **4. Force Vercel to Recognize Environment Variables**
Itâ€™s possible that Vercel is not recognizing `NEXT_DISABLE_ESLINT=1`.

### **A. Set Env Variables in Vercel Dashboard**
1. Go to **Vercel Dashboard**
2. Select your project
3. Go to **Settings â†’ Environment Variables**
4. Add:
   ```
   NEXT_DISABLE_ESLINT = 1
   ```
5. Deploy again.

### **B. Delete Vercel Build Cache**
1. In your **Vercel Dashboard**, go to **Deployments**
2. Click on the failed deployment
3. Find the "Redeploy" button and choose **"Clear Cache & Redeploy"**

---

## **5. If All Else Fails â€“ Suppress Specific Rules**
If ESLint **still runs** even after disabling it, selectively ignore rules in affected files.

For example, add this to the top of files that cause ESLint errors:

```tsx
/* eslint-disable @typescript-eslint/no-unused-vars, react/no-unescaped-entities */
```

Or modify `eslint.config.mjs`:
```js
{
  rules: {
    "@typescript-eslint/no-unused-vars": "off",
    "react/no-unescaped-entities": "off"
  }
}
```

---

## **Final Checklist**
âœ… `NEXT_DISABLE_ESLINT=1` is set in `.env.production` and Vercel dashboard  
âœ… `next.config.js` includes `eslint: { ignoreDuringBuilds: true }`  
âœ… `.eslintrc.json` is **removed** if `eslint.config.mjs` is used  
âœ… `npm run lint` runs successfully before deployment  
âœ… **If all else fails**, suppress ESLint rules at the file level  

---

This should **guarantee a successful deployment**. Try these steps and let me know what happens! ðŸš€
